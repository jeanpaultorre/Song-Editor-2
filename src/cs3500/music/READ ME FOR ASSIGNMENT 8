Updates:

Added a provider package.
I've put a READ ME file in the provider package.

Added an adapter package.
I've pu a READ ME file in the adapter package.

Provider did not provide a Composite view so I worked with what I had.

I changed the main method in MusicEditor to work with an adapter.

Type in file then view in order to bring up
composite = "composite" This will throw an error because provider did not provide one.
guiView = "visual"
midi = "midi"
console = "console"
