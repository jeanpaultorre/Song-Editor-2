# Song-Editor-2


Song Editor Designed for class project.

Note: There are a lot of things that I would do differently now after taking an Algorithms course.
However, this was an Object Oriented Design course where efficiency wasn't the most crucial aspect. 

Uses the Model View Controller architecture for design
Used the Factory Pattern to select between Views
Used the Adapter Pattern to make someone else's View work with my model
